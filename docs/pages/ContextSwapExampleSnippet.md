# Context swap example

Small presentation of context system. Below you can see the very same component without context, and with custom context. You can gauge customizability effort by the size of config.

## Default

<ContextSwapExampleSnippet/>

## Custom context

<ContextSwapExampleÐ¡ustomSnippet/>

That's all code required to make the change.
