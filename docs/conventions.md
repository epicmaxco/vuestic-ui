## Components
### Props
* `color` prop should be used for `background-color`
* `text-color` prop should be used for css `color`
* `size` both string and numeric value should be supported (string: `"200px"`, `"2rem""`; numeric: `200`). In case of numeric value we consider it `px`.

### Components should be

* Stateless. For example, checkbox shouldn't be toggleable without value prop.
* Tabbable. Should be operatable with keyboard alone.
* Demoable. All components and all component features should be covered with demos.
* Pretty. Should fit design (all of it).
* Independent. Relying on external library should be well though.
    
### Small things to note

* Translations are done with `$t('key')` syntax, not `'key' | translate`.
* `prop="string-value"` is used instead of `:prop="'string-value'"`.
* Short syntax is used for boolean props where possible (`hide` instead of `:hide="true"`).
* Self closing tags are used where possible (`<slot/>` instead of `<slot></slot>`).
* BEM is used for styles.
* Rems are used for sizes (except for cases where it doesn't make sense).
* No shortcuts: always `button` and not `btn`.
* Use shortened function declaration:`buttonClass () {` instead of `buttonClass: function () {`.

## CSS
* We have both mixins (where that's possible) and global helpers. Mixins are prefixed with `va-`. Global classes are not prefixed.
* Html tags are unstyled. For example, `table`, `li`, `h1` etc won't give you any styling. Styles are applied either via classes or `.content` wrapper.

### Fonts

* General text: `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro:400,700`
* Icons: `https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons`
