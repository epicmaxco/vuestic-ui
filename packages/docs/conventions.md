## Components

### Props

* `color` prop should be used for `background-color`
* `text-color` prop should be used for css `color`
* `size` both string and numeric value should be supported (string: `"200px"`, `"2rem""`; numeric: `200`). In case of numeric value we consider it `px`.

### Components should be

* **Stateless**. For example, checkbox shouldn't be toggleable without value prop.
* **Tabbable**. Should be operable with keyboard alone.
* **Demoable**. All components and all component features should be covered with demos.
* **Pretty**. Should fit design (all of it).
* **Independent**. Relying on external library should be well though.
* **Cross-browser**. IE10+ for all major browsers.
* **Mobile-friendly**. Operate on mobile properly.

In future we also plan to be :
* **Accessible**. Should use semantic tags and aria-attributes.
* **Tested**. We want significant test coverage for core-functionality.
    
### Small things to note

* `prop="string-value"` is used instead of `:prop="'string-value'"`.
* Short syntax is used for boolean props where possible (`hide` instead of `:hide="true"`).
* Self closing tags are used where possible (`<slot/>` instead of `<slot></slot>`).
* No shortcuts: always `button` and not `btn`. Your naming should be well understood by all developers.

## TypeScript usage

* You can use `@ts-nocheck` | `@ts-ignore` | `any` where it's appropriate. We want strict typing not to get in way of development. Also some mixins or plugins, such as context are fairly challenging to implement in a way to keep typing intact, and there is no much point given we will transition to Composition API sometime in the future.

## Style

* BEM is used for styles.
* Rems are used for sizes (except for cases where it doesn't make sense).

### Global classes

* Global helpers should be considered a separate library/plugin. Components should not rely on global classes!
* All vuestic global classes should be prefixed with `va-`.
* Html tags are unstyled. For example, `table`, `li`, `h1` etc won't give you any styling. Apply styles either via classes or `.content` wrapper.

### Components

* Mixins should be used for style logic reuse inside components.

### Fonts

* General text: `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro:400,700`
* Icons: `https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons`

## Code style

* You should always use a relative path when importing (no aliases)

## Github tags

We want to keep these consistent across different repos.
