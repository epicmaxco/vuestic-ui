        <h1>Girl, no you don’t</h1>
        <p>
          <i>Every time a straight girl tells me “I wish I was a lesbian”, I
            want to light myself on fire.</i>
        </p>
        <p>Picture it. Walk with me for a second.</p>
        <p>
          You enter into your favorite local bar looking good as hell, but you know the only
          heads you want to turn—spicy & stylish alpha bitches—are heavily
          fixated on the D. The hot girl talks to you, but she only wants to
          be your best friend. Her nonthreatening and attentive best friend.
          Receiver of sexy selfies, listener of stories. Meanwhile, you
          attract unwanted attention from straight men, pudgy and greasy
          moths to your emotionally distant flame.
        </p>
        <h3>
          The only place you can go out and feel desired is a <i>lesbian</i>
          party. There is a reason lesbian bars no longer exist. Women
          aren’t taught to approach each other. We’re taught to cross our
          arms and judge. You worry about the shape of your eyebrows now?
          The stage of your roots? You haven’t felt fully judged until
          you’ve been in a room full of scowling women who want to fuck each
          other.
        </h3>
        <p>
          For years, your friends, family members, and medical professionals
          will doubt your continued homosexual confessions. They will tell
          you that you “haven’t met the right man.” Sex with women is fine.
          That’s allowed. You can be “experimental,” a titillating object of
          the male gaze. You can be fluid. But you want to partner with a
          woman? No no. You must be mistaken. You tend to believe them,
          because you’ve been conditioned to disbelieve yourself, to instead
          defer to the voices of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will experience years of confusion about your sexuality,
          because you haven’t been taught to prioritize your own sexual
          desire. None of your female friends orgasm anyway. And if they do,
          it’s definitely not from penetration. Everyone’s a little in love
          with their best friend, right? Maybe you just haven’t met the
          right man.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word “crazy” continues to come up whenever you discuss your
          love life, because mainstream society still associates lesbian
          love with mental instability. If you’re femme-presenting, you will
          hear wildly homophobic statements in your presence. You will hear
          people opine about single brothers, cousins, uncles who are
          “obviously gay,” which doesn’t bother you. But then you’ll hear
          them mention their unhinged friend, about whom they express a
          performative concern, tinged with excitement: “She went to rehab
          and then she dated a woman…. That’s just Crazy Carrie for you!”
        </p>
        <p>
          A family member to tell you that your “alarming lifestyle”
          has required them to seek therapy. Your mom will tell you that she
          “supports you no matter what” but that it would be “much easier
          for everyone if you dated a man.” Your love life will become a
          burden, something that frightens people. You will go to the Deep
          South for the holidays and your Grandmother will quite literally
          scream when you confirm her suspicions that you do, in fact, have
          a girlfriend...
